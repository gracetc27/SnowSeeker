# SnowSeeker
Project 19 in my 100 days of SwiftUI- Hacking with Swift journey. Snowseeker was the final project in this course. 
The app is designed for users who want to gain information about ski resorts for a potential holiday. They can scroll through a list of ski resorts, 
then select any from the list which navigates to a detail view for that resort. Here they can also favourite resorts, which will then display a heart next to the resort name in the original list view. 
Their favourites are saved to UserDefaults.

# Features
- Mixture of using MVVM architecture, a ResortManager and the Environment for Favourites.
- Uses NavigationSplitView in combination with HorizontalSizeClass and Group() to make views look great on both iPhone and iPad.
- Using optionals within alerts.
- Saving and loading from UserDefaults
- Searchable lists, also with sorting options.
